ðŸ”¥ Inner Workings
=================

Here's an overview of how ðŸ”¥ works, generated with ðŸ”¥ itself. With the overall size of ðŸ”¥ being ~200 lines, this is kind of overkill but it does serve as an example of what can be done:

> You might be wondering why you see ðŸš€ and ðŸš— in the snippets instead of ðŸ”¥ and ðŸ§¯. The reason is that ðŸ”¥ allows you to specify the emojis delimiting snippets. So for the ðŸ”¥ code itself, which references ðŸ”¥ and ðŸ§¯ as block delimiters by default, ðŸš€ and ðŸš— are used instead. This allows ðŸ”¥ to run on itself to generate this documentation.

{{ macros.render('illiterally-implementation') }}

The stuff above is a code block rendered with the provided markdown template. ðŸ”¥ highlights that this is a block and provides a link to the source file, then includes the block itself. Any nested blocks are condensed. It also provides a list of direct links to the nested links.

> Except for the code block itself, none of the above is done by ðŸ”¥. It's actually customized by the template, which provides links to the source file, sub-block links and breadcrumbs (See {{macros.ref('block-definition')}}) for lower block levels. Also the `utility-functions` bullet is not a link because the block hasn't been rendered anywhere in the output. The markdown template prints an error for blocks that are referenced but not rendered {{ macros.ref('utility-functions') }} or that are referenced but don't exist at all {{ macros.ref('missing-block') }}.

## Main Entry Point

The main function for ðŸ”¥ is quite simple. It just reads the input files, parses out their block structures, then renders each into a text string. Finally it loads and renders out the output templates, providing the previously rendered blocks as an argument. That sounds like quite a bit, but it's only around 40loc: 

{{ macros.render('entry-point') }}

## Block Structure

Blocks represent parsed snippets of the input and store their ancestor and descendants and path to the root, all referenced as slugs (see below). The hierarchy information allows navigation links and breadcrumbs between code snippets. The blocks also store information about the line they start at, the file they were produced from and the slug that will be used to reference them:

{{ macros.render('block-definition') }}

> With the markdown template, nested blocks provide back-links as ***breadcrumbs*** to access multiple levels of hierarchy quickly. 

The final field, `Block.rendered` contains the rendered text from the block template. Output templates can reference this with `blocks['block-slug'].rendered`, where `block-slug` is the ***sluggified*** version of the name provided at the start of the block.

## Block Parser

The parser is a simple recursive descent bracket matching parser.  

{{ macros.render('block-reader') }}

The parser itself is a class simply to maintain the small amount of state needed to track blocks that are encountered, the state of the input file and so on:

{{ macros.render('parser-state') }}

The `BlockParser` class should not be instantiated directly. Instead the entry point for the parser is the static method `BlockReader.index_blocks`:

{{ macros.render('entry-point-for-parsing') }}

It just sets up a dummy block that will be discarded and starts the recursion. The recursion just reads lines and checks for opening/closing emojis. If none are present, the current line is appended to the open block (initially a dummy block). Whenever a closing emoji is found, the current block ends and the function returns. Whenever an opening emoji is found, the function recurses on a new block, setting up hierarchy references and suspending adding lines to the previous block until the new block is complete.

{{ macros.render('block-parsing') }}

Bracket parsing is very simple, emojis are converted to a text representation and the input line is split with them. Content following open delimiters is stripped and forms a new snippet name:

{{ macros.render('bracket-detection') }}

That's illiterally it.
